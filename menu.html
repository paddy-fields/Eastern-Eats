                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Marinate the chicken: In a medium bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice wine,
                        and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the chicken and stir gently to coat.
                        Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Prepare the sauce: In another bowl, combine the black vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce,
                        sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, and Sichuan pepper. Stir until the sugar and cornstarch are
                        dissolved
                        and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        You may need to turn on your stove's exhaust fan, because stir-frying dried chilies on high
                        heat
                        can get a little smoky. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until a bead of water
                        sizzles and
                        evaporates on contact. Add the peanut oil and swirl to coat the base. Add the chilies and
                        stir-fry for
                        about 30 seconds, or until the chilies have just begun to blacken and the oil is slightly
                        fragrant. Add
                        the chicken and stir-fry until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Add the scallion whites, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds. Pour in the
                        sauce and mix
                        to coat the other ingredients. Stir in the peanuts and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
                        Transfer to a serving
                        plate, sprinkle the scallion greens on top, and serve.

                    <li>
                        Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add cabbage and cook, 
                        tossing often, until edges are browned, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue 
                        to cook, tossing often, until thickest parts of cabbage leaves are tender, about 
                        4 minutes longer. Remove from heat and set skillet aside.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Place udon in a large heatproof bowl (or pot if you don’t have one) and cover 
                        with 6 cups boiling water. Let sit 1 minute, stirring to break up noodles, then 
                        drain in a colander. Transfer noodles back to bowl and toss with sesame oil. 
                        Transfer cabbage to bowl with noodles. Wipe out skillet.

                    <li>
                        Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in same skillet over medium-high and add 
                        pork, breaking up and spreading across surface of pan with a spatula or tongs. 
                        Cook pork, undisturbed, until underside is brown, about 3 minutes. The pork will 
                        never brown if you’re fussing with it the whole time, so when we say “undisturbed,” 
                        that means keep your paws off it and let the heat of the pan and the pork do their 
                        thing.

                        When pork is browned, break up meat into small bits. Cook, tossing, just until 
                        there’s no more pink, about 1 minute. Add chopped scallions (the pale parts), 
                        ginger, and red pepper. Continue to cook, tossing often, until scallions are 
                        softened and bottom of skillet has started to brown, about 1 minute. Add udon 
                        mixture, mirin, and soy sauce and cook, tossing constantly, until noodles are 
                        coated in sauce (be sure to scrape bottom of skillet to dissolve any browned bits), 
                        about 45 seconds. Remove from heat and fold in 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds and dark-green 
                        parts of scallions. Top with more sesame seeds before serving.

                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p><strong>Hot Chili Mayo</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do ahead; can be made 1 day ahead. Stir all ingredients in small bowl. Season with salt.</li>
                    <li>Cover and chill.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Meatballs</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do ahead; can be made 1 day ahead. Line rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap. Gently mix all ingredients in large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Using moistened hands and scant tablespoonful for each, roll meat mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Arrange on baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Cover and chill.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Sandwiches</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Toss first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, tossing occasionally.</li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat sesame oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of meatballs. 
                        Sauté until brown and cooked through, turning meatballs often and lowering heat if browning too quickly, 
                        about 15 minutes. Transfer meatballs to another rimmed baking sheet. Place in oven. Repeat with remaining 
                        meatballs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut each baguette or baguette piece horizontally in half. Pull out enough bread from each bread half to leave 
                        1/2-inch-thick shell. Spread hot chili mayo over each bread shell. Arrange jalapeños, then cilantro, in bottom halves. 
                        Fill each with 1/4 of meatballs. Drain pickled vegetables; place atop meatballs. Press on baguette tops and serve.
